# Image Processing Toolbox üñºÔ∏è

This application provides a comprehensive set of image processing tools organized into multiple categories for advanced image manipulation and analysis.

## üîß Available Filter Categories

- **Point Operations**: Brightness, contrast, gamma correction
- **Color Processing**: Grayscale conversion, color channel manipulation
- **Histogram Operations**: Equalization, adaptive methods
- **Neighborhood Processing**: Blur, sharpening, noise reduction
- **Image Restoration**: Noise addition/removal, inverse filtering
- **Segmentation**: Thresholding, clustering methods
- **Edge Detection**: Sobel, Canny, Laplacian
- **Mathematical Morphology**: Erosion, dilation, opening, closing
- **Advanced Filters**: Bilateral, non-local means, guided filter
- **Transformations**: Rotation, scaling, perspective

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Upload an image** using the file uploader in the sidebar.
2. **Select a filter category** and operation.
3. **Adjust parameters** as needed.
4. **Apply the filter** and see real-time results.
5. **Chain multiple filters** to achieve desired effects.
6. **Download** your processed image.
